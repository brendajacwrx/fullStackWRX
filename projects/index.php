            <p>This is a  basic form with no JavaScript that I have clients who think they can code their website start with.  I direct them to the Bootstrap website, as a reference, and instruct them that the first state will be their state, but the states must be listed aplphabetically.<a href="project1/">...see form..</a></p>

            <p>For those familiar with desktop programming, this is an example of learning PHP and emphasizing how to seperate the functionality of the PHP from the display HTML, starting the concept of separating the view from the functionality. Looping, concatenation, and table creation in PHP is the emphasis preparing for extracting and displaying data from databases. In addition this exemplifies to the learner how block level and inline objects interact in the Document Model Object (DOM)<a href="project2" title="see results">..see form..</a></p>

            <p>This is a project using classes to manipulate the content entered into a form. The first and last name is entered seperated by a space and when &#34;Add Name&#34; is activated the name is added to a list in the textarea alphabetically by last name then first name seperated by a comma.  The &#34;Clear Names&#34; button clears the list from the text area.<a href="project4" title="see name list">... see list ...</a> One <a href="https://github.com/brendajacwrx/fullStackWRX/blob/main/projects/project4/addNameProc.php" title="see code">class</a> changes the name format, adds the name and clears the name, in essence, determining what to do when the button is clicked.

            <img src="../images/fileDir.PNG" alt="create file and directory">
            <p>This project is an example of creating files and directories.  The user enters a directory name and some textual content for a file, and upon submission, a directory will be created in the allowable directories, inserting the textual content into a file named “readme.txt” in that directory created.  The path of the file and directory will display upon completion.  Clicking the path, the file will open in the browser window.  Two files are used, one to <a href="https://github.com/brendajacwrx/fullStackWRX/blob/main/projects/project5/index.php" title="see code">display the forms</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/brendajacwrx/fullStackWRX/blob/main/projects/project5/directory.php" title="see code">class</a> to handle the methods necessary to create the file and directory.  The directory cannot be duplicated, and the directory that can accept new directories must have the proper 777 permissions set already.<a href="project5" title="see forms">...see file and directory form...</a></p>
